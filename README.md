# NeoVim Config (in Lua)

The latest (as of June 2025) iteration of my NeoVim config...

## Install

- Clone to `~/.config/nvim`
- Install a patched font (if you don't already have one (hint; do your nvim-tree folders have icons?))
  [Automice Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and set it up in your term emulator
- Symlink to your `~/.config/nvim` directory if needed
- Open nvim and let Lazy.nvim do it's thing!
